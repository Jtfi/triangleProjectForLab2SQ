# triangleProjectForLab2SQ
A intro to using github and test cases using the TDD style, this was taught in my Software Quality course.

I'm still new and I know I did something wrong I think... Like I set up this repository because I'm doing an assignment but I think repositories like this one in genereal should have been named "SoftwareQualityAssignments" so that then I post all my folders/files of all the assignments I am doing... you know that sounds a lot better then I can have projects also of the particular classes
